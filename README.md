# Group-7
Project work for Nazor, Mafred, Arnold, Mariam

## Aim
The group created a Python program that generates a random quote each time it is ran. The program read the csv file titled "Quotes" which contain the list of quotes and their authors and randomly select one quote to print out to the console along with its corresponding author.

## To Add New Quotes To The CSV file
This steps below take you through how to add new quotes to the csv file.

**Step 1:**
Save this respository on your pc by clicking on the "" or clone this respository to your profile and save to your pc.

**Step 2:** 
Open the csv file marked "Quotes" and add your new quotes to the file.
Alternatively,
you might want to change the file type of "Quotes" first from .csv to .xls to that you can edit (ie., add your new quotes) using Excel. Then, while saving the updated file, save as .csv file as extension. Take note of the updated filename you use.

**Step 3:**
Now open the python code marked "Random_Quotes.py" (if you are using pythonCharm), OR "Random_Quotes.pynb (if you are using the
Jupyter Notebook) and change the csv filename from "Quotes" to the updated filename you use from Step 2.

Finally, run your python code.
