# Group-7
This is the Project work for Nazor, Mafred, Arnold, Mariam

## Aim
The group created a Python program that generates a random quote each time it is ran. The program read the csv file titled "Quotes" which contain the list of quotes and their authors and randomly select one quote to print out to the console along with its corresponding author.


## To Add New Quotes To The CSV file
To do this, refer to the steps in the "README.md" at the "main" branch. The steps will take you through how to add new quotes to the csv file.
